# New blog!

Hey y'all! I finally got around to actully creating the blog I always wanted to create. Not that I really like wiriting or blogging, but I think it is a good way to document my projects and my progres and actually start documenting my thoughts and ideas. This also means that sometimes my blogposts may be hard to follow, feel rambling or just plain stupid. This is due that for me this is primarily a way to document my work/hobby, so please don't take it too seriously. I will try to keep my posts as short as possible, and I will also try to add to them regularly but I can't promise anything.

If you have any questions at all please contact me on twitter or via mail (you can find my mail address on my [about page](/about/) or add an issue to the respective repository on [github](www.github.com/jahknem)).

I hope you enjoy it!
