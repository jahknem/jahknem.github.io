# Streamlining Tailscale Installation on Roborock Vacuums

Sometimes, the simplest solutions can be the most effective. This project is a straightforward, yet useful script to install Tailscale on a Roborock vacuum robot. It's not about reinventing the wheel, but about making practical improvements to our daily tech. Here's a rundown of what it entails and why it's useful.

## The Idea

The primary goal was to enable Tailscale, a private network service, on a Roborock vacuum. This integration is about enhancing the device's functionality with a secure, remote access capability.

## The Script

The script, written in ash shell, is concise and purposeful. It focuses on two main tasks:

1. **Detecting the CPU Architecture**: This is to ensure the correct version of Tailscale is downloaded for the specific model of the Roborock.
2. **Downloading and Relocating Tailscale**: It then fetches the appropriate package and moves it to the necessary directory for installation.

The script includes necessary checks to ensure each step is completed successfully, thereby minimizing potential errors during the installation.

## GitHub Repository

For those interested, the script is available on GitHub: [Roborock-Tailscale-Installer](https://github.com/jahknem/Roborock-Tailscale-Installer). The repository is straightforward, hosting the script and a README for easy installation.

## Practical Use

This integration isn't about complex challenges; it's about practicality and enhancing the functionality of everyday devices. By enabling Tailscale on a Roborock vacuum, users gain more control and accessibility, which is a step forward in home automation.

## Closing Thoughts

This project is a testament to how even simple scripts can significantly impact how we interact with our technology. It's a small, yet practical stride in the realm of home automation and networking.
