## Context / Problem
During my internship at **Blue Networks GmbH** (October 2020 – March 2021), a robust solution for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) was needed. The goal was to centrally control and log network access.

## Responsibilities
*   Design of an AAA architecture based on the open-source server **FreeRADIUS**.
*   Setup of a test environment to simulate realistic load scenarios.
*   Configuration of RADIUS attributes and policies for different user groups.
*   Documentation of configuration and test results.

## Tech Stack
*   **Software:** FreeRADIUS
*   **Protocols:** RADIUS, EAP
*   **OS:** Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

## Outcome
*   Successful validation of the AAA concept in the test environment.
*   Demonstration of the functionality and stability of the FreeRADIUS implementation.
*   Provision of a solid foundation for the subsequent production rollout.

## Lessons Learned / Next Steps
Correctly configuring RADIUS requires a deep understanding of network protocols and security requirements. The work highlighted the importance of standardized testing procedures before transitioning to live operation.
