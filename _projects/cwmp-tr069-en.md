## Context / Problem
Continuing my work at **Blue Networks GmbH**, I focused on Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) management. The task was to evaluate how end devices (e.g., routers) could be remotely managed via the WAN Management Protocol (CWMP / TR-069).

## Responsibilities
*   Research and evaluation of ACS (Auto Configuration Server) solutions.
*   Setup of a prototype for managing CPEs.
*   Testing communication between ACS and various end devices.
*   Analysis of possibilities for automatic firmware updates and configuration.

## Tech Stack
*   **Protocols:** TR-069 / CWMP
*   **Software:** Likely GenieACS (or comparable open-source solution)
*   **Infrastructure:** Linux Server, diverse CPE hardware

## Outcome
*   Successful setup of a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) system.
*   Insights into the interoperability of different CPE manufacturers with the ACS.
*   Assessment of TR-069's suitability for the company's specific requirements.

## Lessons Learned / Next Steps
TR-069 is a powerful but complex protocol. Interoperability between different vendors is often a challenge. In the future, modern approaches like USP (TR-369) are gaining importance.
