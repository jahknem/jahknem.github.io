## Context / Problem
At **RoNikJa** (Jan 2020 – Nov 2021), the task was to develop a digital microscope system that could be controlled in a modern and user-friendly way via mobile devices. Simultaneously, I was responsible for maintaining the internal IT infrastructure.

## Responsibilities
*   Development of **firmware** for the microscope's microcontroller (controlling optics, lighting, data transfer).
*   Development of an **Android app** (client) for displaying the microscope image and controlling functions.
*   Maintenance and operation of internal infrastructure (GitLab, servers).
*   Ensuring communication between hardware and the app.

## Tech Stack
*   **Embedded:** C/C++, Microcontroller
*   **Mobile:** Android (Java/Kotlin)
*   **Tools:** Git, CI/CD
*   **Infrastructure:** Linux, Virtualization

## Outcome
*   Functional prototype and production-ready system of a digital microscope.
*   User-friendly app that increases the flexibility of microscope usage.
*   Stable internal development environment through maintained infrastructure.

## Lessons Learned / Next Steps
The close integration of low-level hardware programming and app development requires a broad skillset. This experience underscores the value of clean interface definitions and automated tests in embedded projects.
