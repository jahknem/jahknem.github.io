Welcome to the Blog of @jahknem (my blog), a Website for my thoughts and ideas. I am a student of computer engineering and I am interested in programming, web development, and other things. I am also interested in the Linux operating system and the open source community. 
For a long time I have been thinking about starting a blog, but I have never really done it. Now I have finally started it. I hope you enjoy it.
